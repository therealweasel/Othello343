# Othello343

A simulation of the boardgame Reversi/Othello created for my CSCI343 (AI) class to better understand state spaces, heuristic strategies, etc. Current implementation is designed to work with a 'Referee' 
intermediary program that served to facilitate the game and validate moves. I might try to implement an evalulation function (Monte-Carlo/Alpha-Beta) rather than 
my current heuristic (MaxDisk) to better understanding that process.
